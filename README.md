# RemoteControlProject

  ▶ RemoteControl v2.0.0 is a personal project to improve skills.<br><br>
  ▶ I've tried to understand technic what I used and why it's useful, when I use it.<br><br>
  
# Support Function
▶ Remote client, which I call 'customer', offers its screen to another client, which I call 'host'.<br>
The host could control customer's mouse pointer and keyboard but, it doesn't work perfectly.<br>
Server support p2p mode and relay mode. It's possible to connect on these 2 modes in parallel.<br>
In addition, I made an application for smart phone. It is like the'host' client.<br><br>

< p.s I couldn't test well on relay mode because of limited environment... <br>
      This project might work well without optimizing option in VS20xx ><br>

# I used...
  C, C++, MFC, Android, Java<br>
  
# Version Information
  ▶ v1.x.x is based on udp protocol. It includes udp server and 2 clients.<br><br>
  ▶ v2.0.0 has different sever which is based on IOCP.<br><br>
  Actually, I know that IOCP is not appropriate for p2p and udp but, I just wanna implement the server using it.<br>
 

# What I've learned

  ▶ I could learn how to obtain information that I need during this project. I also have confidence in learning somthing I'm not used to. It could need quite long time but, I beleive I can make it. I consider this experience is the most valuable thing among others.<br><br>
  ▶ Not only technical ability, but also being into factors around people. In the other word, Success of software can be change by those factor like position of button they prefer is up to their habbits.<br><br>
  ▶ Open source is really powerful. I can't imagine me using github without it, I would have been suffering from bugs. I could find people make their code better and discuss about suitable technic sharing it each other. I think it is so important skill for us to know how to make use of open sources today.
